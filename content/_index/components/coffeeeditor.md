[The "coffee editor"](https://github.com/eclipsesource/coffee-editor) is a comprehensive example of a web-based modeling tool based on EMF.cloud, including a form-based editor based on JSON Forms, a diagram based on GLSP, a textual DSL, a code generator and a graphical visualization of an analysis result using D3. The coffee editor uses the model sever for synchronizing all editors and it is  embedded into [the Eclipse Theia IDE](https://eclipsesource.com/technology/eclipse-theia)

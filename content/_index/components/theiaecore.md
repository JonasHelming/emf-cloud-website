The <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-emfcloud/ecore-glsp">GLSP-based Ecore editor</a> integrated in the Eclipse Theia IDE provides a web-based version of the popular Ecore tools. It allows you to graphically create and modify Ecore Models using a diagram editor integrated in the web-based IDE Eclipse Theia. We are currently working on a model project creation wizard as well as work on integrating the existing EMF code generator.
